My approach:
    if head is the target, just set next to null (unlink it)
    set pointer to next's next (skip target's link in the chain)
    if tail is head set prev's next to null

    rm 2:
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    1 -> 3 -> 4
    point curr's next to the next one after next

    rm 1:
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    2 -> 3 -> 4
    ?? maybe set first one's next to null

    rm 4:
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    1 -> 2 -> 3
    set curr's next to null
